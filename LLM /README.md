## What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an advanced type of artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with high accuracy and fluency.

## Key Features of LLMs

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** LLMs can comprehend the meaning and context of human language.
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** They can produce coherent and contextually relevant text that resembles human writing.
- **Context Awareness:** LLMs consider previous sentences or context to generate relevant responses.
- **Transfer Learning:** They are typically pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
