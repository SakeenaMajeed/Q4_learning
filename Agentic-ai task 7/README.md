# Exploration of OpenAI Agents SDK

## What is OpenAI Agents SDK?

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a software development kit provided by OpenAI that helps developers build **autonomous AI agents**. These agents are advanced AI programs powered by OpenAIâ€™s large language models (like GPT) that can think, plan, and take actions on their own.

Unlike simple chatbots that just respond with text, these agents can perform real tasks by interacting with external tools, APIs, or systems automatically.

## Why Use OpenAI Agents SDK?

1. **Enable Autonomous AI**  
   The SDK allows AI agents to not just respond but to make decisions and act independently without constant human instructions.

2. **Connect to External Tools and APIs**  
   Agents can call other services like calendars, web searches, email systems, or any custom APIs you provide, expanding their capabilities.

3. **Automate Complex Workflows**  
   Multi-step tasks that require planning, fetching data, analyzing it, and acting on it can be done fully automatically by the agent.

4. **Customize Agent Abilities**  
   Developers can define the tools, commands, and actions an agent can use, tailoring the AI for specific applications.

## Core Components of OpenAI Agents SDK

- **Agent**  
  The intelligent entity that understands input, plans a course of action, and carries it out.

- **Tools**  
  These are the functions, APIs, or commands that the agent can call to perform tasks. Examples include:  
  - Searching the web  
  - Managing calendar events  
  - Sending emails  
  - Running calculations

- **Memory**  
  The agent can remember past interactions and information to keep context, making conversations and task handling smarter.

- **Environment**  
  The platform or app where the agent operates â€” this could be your own application, a web service, or any system that integrates the agent.

---

## How Does an Agent Work?

1. **Receives a Task or Query**  
   The agent is given a request, like "Check my meetings for tomorrow and remind me."

2. **Plans the Actions Needed**  
   It decides which tools to use and in what order to fulfill the task.

3. **Executes Actions**  
   The agent calls the necessary APIs or performs computations (like calling the calendar API).

4. **Returns Results**  
   It gives back the final response or may ask follow-up questions if clarification is needed.

## Benefits of Using OpenAI Agents SDK

- **Autonomous Decision Making**  
  Agents can independently figure out what to do next without waiting for explicit commands every time.

- **Multi-tool Integration**  
  Agents can use many tools simultaneously, making them very versatile.

- **Flexibility and Customization**  
  You control what the agent can do by defining tools and workflows.

- **Efficient Automation**  
  Saves time by automating repetitive or complex tasks.

- **Better User Interaction**  
  Agents can interact naturally and helpfully, improving user experience.

---

## Example Use Case

Imagine you want an AI assistant that can:

- Fetch weather updates  
- Check and update your calendar  
- Set reminders  

Using the SDK, you define three tools: a weather API, a calendar API, and a reminders API. The agent learns to decide when and how to call each tool to fulfill your requests, all on its own.

## Getting Started with OpenAI Agents SDK

> This document is an overview of concepts and benefits. For actual coding and setup, refer to OpenAIâ€™s official documentation.

To create your own agent:

1. **Define Tools:** Specify which external services or commands the agent can use.  
2. **Configure Agent:** Set up the agent with access permissions and memory.  
3. **Implement Logic:** Program how the agent plans and executes tasks.  
4. **Test and Iterate:** Run various scenarios to make sure the agent behaves as expected.

# ðŸ§  Agent & Runner Architecture - Python AI System

This README explains the core logic and structure behind the `Agent` and `Runner` classes, and the use of generics in Python for handling flexible types such as `TContext`.

---

## 1. Why is the Agent class defined as a `@dataclass`?

The `Agent` class is defined using Pythonâ€™s `@dataclass` decorator to simplify class creation. With `@dataclass`, boilerplate code such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` is automatically generated.

### âœ… Benefits:
- Auto-generates constructors and common methods
- Reduces repetitive code
- Improves readability and structure

---

## 2a. Why does the Agent class contain the system prompt as instructions? Why is the Agent callable?

The **system prompt** defines the Agent's personality or role. Making the `Agent` callable allows cleaner and more natural syntax.

### âœ… Benefits:
- Keeps system instructions stored inside the Agent
- Allows direct interaction like: `agent("What's the weather today?")`

---

## 2b. Why is the user prompt passed to `run()` in Runner? Why is it a `@classmethod`?

The user prompt is passed to `run()` because it's different every time. Using `@classmethod` allows calling `run()` without creating a `Runner` object.

### âœ… Benefits:
- Simpler interface: `Runner.run("Hi there")`
- Centralized AI execution logic
- Reduces object creation overhead

---

## 3. What is the purpose of the Runner class?

The `Runner` class acts as a **controller** between the user and the Agent. It initializes the Agent, passes input, and returns the result.

### âœ… Responsibilities:
- Accepts user input
- Initializes Agent
- Handles flow between input and AI output

---

## 4. What are Generics in Python? Why use it for `TContext`?

Generics are a way to make classes and functions flexible with different types. `TContext` is a generic type variable for representing different forms of context in an Agent.

### âœ… Benefits:
- Type-safe and reusable
- Adapts to any kind of context (string, dict, object)
- Promotes scalable and flexible agent design

| `user prompt`     | Passed at runtime since it changes every time                               |
| `Runner` class    | Connects user input with Agent logic; simplifies user interaction           |
| `Generic[TContext]`| Allows Agent to work with any context type (flexible and reusable)         |

## ðŸ’¡ Final Note

This structure enables scalable and modular AI system design. It ensures reusability, separation of concerns, and clean interaction patterns between the Agent and user input â€” perfect for production-ready AI assistants or chatbots.
